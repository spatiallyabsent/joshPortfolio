                Hello! My name is Joshua and I'm a web developer who finds passion in learning online technologies. 
                I view the web as an extension of human expression, a way to push and create our desires and dreams, 
                and a fast track to paving our way to the future. I am a full stack developer with a focus on creativity,
                user experiencce, and collaberation. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

                Some of the programs I've had past experience in include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and 
                Mustache.js. I've also had experience with databases such as MongoDB and MySQL. Currently I am working on
                growing my skills in these technologies but am always on the look out for new technologies that let creators and
                developers do incredible things.
